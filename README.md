![Butr Logo](logo.png)

Butr is a tiny (3kb~) JavaScript package that can:

- Collect all headings and create a table of contents with links
- Update the table of contents to indicate which link is currently in view
- Smoothly animate scroll to any location or element - like butter ;)
- Automatically animate scroll on any anchor with the `data-butr` attribute
